# Git and Github
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems) 

GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.
