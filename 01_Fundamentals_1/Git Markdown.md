# [Git Markdown]


## Key terminology

Markdown - Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. 

WYSIWYG - An acronym for What You See Is What You Get, is a system in which editing software allows content to be edited in a form that resembles its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product

WYSIWYM - What You See Is What You Mean is a paradigm for editing a structured document. It is an adjunct to the better-known WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) paradigm, which displays the result of a formatted document as it will appear on screen or in print—without showing the descriptive code underneath

### Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

**Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?**

Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

*Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,*

And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;

Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,

When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:

   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,

   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
