## Key terminology

Markdown - Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. 

WYSIWYG - An acronym for What You See Is What You Get, is a system in which editing software allows content to be edited in a form that resembles its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product

WYSIWYM - What You See Is What You Mean is a paradigm for editing a structured document. It is an adjunct to the better-known WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) paradigm, which displays the result of a formatted document as it will appear on screen or in printâ€”without showing the descriptive code underneath
