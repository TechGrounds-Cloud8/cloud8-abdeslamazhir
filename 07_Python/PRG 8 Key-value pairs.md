# Key-value pairs

Key-value pairs are a general concept you will definitely encounter. Some examples of where you will find them are NoSQL databases or AWS resource tags. Dictionaries (dict) in Python also use key-value pairs to store information.

Dicts in Python are written using curly brackets {}. You can get values from the dict by calling its key.

## Exercise 2


- Create a new script.
- Use user input to ask for their information (first name, last name, job title, company). Store the information in a dictionary.
- Write the information to a csv file (comma-separated values). The data should not be overwritten when you run the script multiple times.
