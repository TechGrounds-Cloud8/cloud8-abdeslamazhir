# Functions

Youâ€™ve already seen and used a couple of functions, like print() and input(). A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. Functions are recognizable by the brackets () next to the function name. These brackets serve as a place to input data into a function.
Functions can return data as a result.

Besides the built-in functions, you can also write custom functions, or import functions from a library or package.
