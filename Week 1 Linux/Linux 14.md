# Bash scripting

Installing apache and creating s script that generates a random number and also indicates when a number is lower dan 5.

## Key terminology
Bash - Bourne again Shell,a command language.

PATH -  A variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search for executable files

## Exercise

1

-Create a directory called ‘scripts’. Place all the scripts you make in this directory.
Add the scripts directory to the PATH variable.

-Create a script that appends a line of text to a text file whenever it is executed.

-Create a script that installs the httpd package, activates httpd, and enables httpd. Finally, your script should print the status of httpd in the terminal.

2

-Create a script that generates a random number between 1 and 10, stores it in a variable, and then appends the number to a text file.

3 

-Create a script that generates a random number between 1 and 10, stores it in a variable, and then appends the number to a text file only if the number is bigger than 5. If the number is 5 or smaller, it should append a line of text to that same text file instead.
