# Shared Responsibility Model

If you manage a data center yourself, you can rest assured that you are responsible for everything from physical security to the security and encryption of your data. But also the maintenance and management of the building where you have your data center and all the staff that is needed for this.
Many of these responsibilities are taken over in the Cloud. The Cloud Provider is then responsible for the physical matters of your infrastructure. And you, as a customer, can rent this infrastructure without having to worry about it.

However, this is not a license. You, as a customer, are still responsible for what you do on this leased infrastructure. These are responsibilities such as access control to data and software, encryption of data at rest and data in transit.
How much responsibilities lie with the customer also depends on what kind of service is purchased. However, there remain responsibilities that are always for the customer.

De Cloud provider extra biedt extra services aan waarmee je je eigen verantwoordelijkheden makkelijker kan beheren.
