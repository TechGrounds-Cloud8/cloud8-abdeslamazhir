# Advantages of the cloud

Cloud computing offers your business many benefits. It allows you to set up what is essentially a virtual office to give you the flexibility of connecting to your business anywhere, any time.

Azure lists 6 advantages of cloud computing. These are basic properties that make the cloud interesting for companies

## Key terminology

- SLA: A service-level agreement defines the level of service you expect from a vendor, laying out the metrics by which service is measured, as well as remedies or penalties should agreed-on service levels not be achieved. It is a critical component of any technology vendor contract.

The 6 advantages of the cloud

 - High Availability: Depending on the Service Level Agreement (SLA) you choose, your cloud apps can provide a continuous user experience with no noticeable downtime, even if something goes wrong.

- Scalability: Apps in the cloud can be scaled vertically and horizontally:
Adjust the scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
Horizontal scaling increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.

- Elasticity: You can configure cloud apps to take advantage of automatic scaling so that your apps always have the resources they need.

- Agility: Quickly deploy and configure cloud resources as your app requirements change.

- Geo-distribution: You can deploy apps and data to regional data centers around the world, so your customers always have the best performance in their region.

- Disaster recovery: Using cloud backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can keep your app



### The consumption-based model


- No upfront costs.

- Azure Cloud computing is a consumption-based model.

- Azure cloud service providers operate on a consumption-based model, meaning that end users only pay for the resources they use. This will replace Capital Expenditure (CapEx) with Operational Expenditure (OpEx).
A consumption-based model has many advantages, including:


- There is no need to buy and manage expensive infrastructure that may not be fully utilized by users.
The ability to pay for additional resources when needed.
The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
